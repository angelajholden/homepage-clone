[![Watch the Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-Watch-blue?logo=youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=[playlist_goes_here])

This is a simple, landing page built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Itâ€™s based on the homepage of [KnitPicks.com](https://www.knitpicks.com/). The goal of this project is to turn an existing design into accessible, modern code â€” and make it easy for anyone to customize or learn from. Itâ€™s mobile responsive and includes an accessibility focus.

_This project is free and open-source, and focused on helping new frontend developers practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript with real-world examples._
